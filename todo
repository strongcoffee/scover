type alias

make a mission trait

randomInt - little faker library to stop toms naughty hardcoded implementations
add full mission parse to missionParserSpec
improve how tom compares the lists
refactor scoverCommanderSpec to have a setup method



DONDE
change console to extend application (tried this - had problems running main class multiple times in featurespec)



NOTEWORTHY
scala 2.8 has default function params and named arguments
StringUtils.joiner for lists
